<h1>Question 1</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Give three reasons for requirements modelling.</span>

Requirements modeling serves several purposes in the software engineering process:

1. Clarifying Requirements: Modeling helps in clarifying and understanding the
stakeholders' requirements by representing them in a structured and visual format,
which reduces ambiguity and ensures a common understanding among project
team members.
2. Communication: It facilitates communication between stakeholders, developers,
and other project team members by providing a visual representation of the
system's requirements that can be easily understood by all parties involved.
3. Documentation: Requirements models serve as documentation for capturing and
preserving the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. They
provide a clear record of what needs to be built and why.
4. Analysis: Models enable analysis of the requirements to ensure completeness,
consistency, and feasibility. They allow stakeholders to explore different
scenarios, identify potential conflicts or gaps, and make informed decisions about
the system's design and implementation.
5. Validation and Verification: Requirements models support validation and
verification activities by providing a basis for assessing whether the proposed
solution meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations. They help in detecting
errors, inconsistencies, and omissions early in the development process.
6. Managing Complexity: Modeling helps in managing the complexity of large and
complex systems by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable
components and relationships.
Overall, requirements modeling enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the software
development process by promoting better understanding, communication, analysis, and
management of requirements.

<br><br><h1>Question 2</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Is it possible to begin coding immediately after a requirements model has been created?</span>
        
While it may be tempting to start coding immediately after creating a requirements
model, it's generally not advisable. Here's why:
1. Incomplete Understanding: Rushing into coding without thorough analysis and
design based on the requirements model can lead to misunderstandings or
misinterpretations of the requirements. This can result in incomplete or incorrect
implementations.
2. Increased Rework: Without a solid understanding of the requirements and a
well-thought-out design, there's a higher likelihood of needing to revisit and
revise the code later. This can lead to increased rework and project delays.
3. Risk of Scope Creep: Starting coding prematurely can make it easier for scope
creep to occur. Additional requirements may surface during the coding process,
leading to frequent changes and disruptions to the development flow.
4. Lack of Alignment: Coding without a clear plan derived from the requirements
model can lead to a lack of alignment between the implemented system and the
stakeholders' expectations. This can result in dissatisfaction and the need for
costly adjustments later.
5. Quality Concerns: Skipping proper analysis and design increases the risk of
introducing errors or bugs into the code. Without adequate planning, the code may
lack modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

<br><br><h1>Question 3</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Describe how the CRC cards can be used to identify classes in requirements analysis.</span>
        
CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) cards are a brainstorming tool used in object-
oriented design to identify classes and their relationships during requirements analysis.

Here's how they can be used:
1. Class Identification:
 Start by identifying the major concepts, entities, or objects in the problem
domain based on the requirements.
 Each major concept becomes a potential class in the system. Write the
name of each class on a separate CRC card.

2. Responsibility Determination:
 For each class identified, determine its responsibilities or what it needs to
do to fulfill its role in the system.
 Write down the responsibilities of each class on the CRC card. These
responsibilities should be specific actions or behaviors that the class will
perform.
3. Collaboration Analysis:
 Identify other classes with which each class interacts or collaborates to
fulfill its responsibilities.
 On the CRC card, list the names of other classes with which the class
collaborates. This collaboration could involve passing messages, sharing
data, or invoking methods.
        
</pre>
<br><br><h1>Question 4</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>There are two different types of “states” that behavioural models can represent. What are they?</span>
        
- The state of each class as the system performs its function.
- The state of the system as observed from the outside as the system performs its function.
        
</pre>
<br><br><h1>Question 5</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>How does a sequence diagram differ from a state diagram? How are they similar?</span>
        
Differences:
 Focus: Sequence diagrams focus on interactions between objects over time, while
state diagrams focus on the states and transitions of an object or system.
 Representation: Sequence diagrams emphasize message passing and the
chronological order of interactions, whereas state diagrams emphasize the states
and transitions of a system's behavior.
 Usage: Sequence diagrams are used to model dynamic behavior and interaction
sequences, while state diagrams are used to model the state-based behavior and
transitions of systems.

Similarities:
 Both are graphical models: Both sequence diagrams and state diagrams are
graphical representations used to model aspects of a system's behavior.
 Used for analysis and design: Both diagrams are employed during software
analysis and design phases to understand and document system behavior.
 Complement each other: While they represent different aspects of behavior,
sequence diagrams and state diagrams can complement each other when modeling
complex systems by providing different perspectives on system behavior.

<br><br><h1>Question 6</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>What is the purpose of the interaction model for a Web/Mobile App?</span>
        
The purpose of the interaction model for a web/mobile app is to outline how users will
interact with the application interface to accomplish their tasks or goals effectively and
intuitively. This model focuses on the user experience (UX) design aspect of the
application and defines how users navigate through the interface, perform actions, and
receive feedback.    

</pre>
<br><br><h1>Question 7</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Draw a use case diagram based on the scenario as described below:

XYZ Bhd needs a patient tracking system that tracks each employee's visit to the
company’s clinic. Each employee has an employee ID, name and position. Employees also
have a smartcard which they will have to tap into the system when they want to go to the
company’s clinic to see a doctor. Employees can also make appointments online to reduce
waiting time at the clinic. The doctor adds to the patient’s medical record regarding the
patient's symptoms and treatment and/or medication prescribed. If the case is too
complicated for the staff doctor to handle, the patient would be referred to a specialist at
one of the panel hospitals. This also needs to be recorded in the patient's medical records.

<br><br><h1>Question 8</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Draw a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers for
a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrolment, so the registration process
must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses an
electronic course catalog to find out about available courses.</span>
