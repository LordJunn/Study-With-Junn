<pre>
In C++, if there’s only one statement following an if or else, you don’t need to use {} (braces). 
The braces are used when you have multiple statements in the if or else block. Here’s an example:
<code>if (num1 == num2)
{
    cout << "The values are the same.";
    cout << "Hey, that's a coincidence!" << endl;
}
else
{
    cout << "The values are not the same" << endl;
}
</code>
In this case, because there are two cout statements when num1 is equal to num2, we need to use braces to group them together. 
If there’s only one cout statement, the braces are optional. 
However, using braces can make your code more readable and less error-prone, especially when modifying it in the future.

When you input 60 as the average, the program doesn’t print anything because the conditions for both if statements are not met. 
The first if statement checks if the average is greater than 60, and the second if statement checks if the average is less than 60. 
When the average is exactly 60, neither condition is true, so nothing is printed.

To fix this, you can modify the first if statement to check if the average is greater than or equal to 60.

Now, when you input 60 as the average, the program will print “You Pass”.

<pre>
This program now uses a series of nested if/else statements to check the average against each category range:

Invalid data check: 
First, it checks if the average is above 100. If yes, it displays an error message.

Category checks: 
Then, it uses descending if statements for each category:
    A: If average is 90 or above, it displays the "A category" message.
    B: If average is 80 or above but less than 90, it displays the "B category" message.
    Pass: If average is 60 or above but less than 80, it displays the "Pass" message.
    Fail: If average is 0 or above but less than 60, it displays the "Fail" message.

Negative value handling: 
Finally, it uses a separate else if statement to specifically catch negative values. 
If the average is less than 0, it displays the same error message as for exceeding 100.

This approach ensures all categories are covered and negative values are handled appropriately.

Entering a negative value like -12 will trigger the last else if statement, displaying the "Invalid data!" message. 
The program interprets negative values as outside the valid range (0-100) and prompts the user to try again with a valid average.

In this version of the program, the if statement checks if gpa is not less than 2.0 and if year is '4'.

Yes, you can definitely replace year != '4' in the else if statement with year < 4 || year <= 3. In fact, both options are functionally equivalent and achieve the same outcome. 
However, there are some subtle differences to consider:

Replacing with year < 4 || year <= 3:
   Advantages:
      More explicit: 
      This option explicitly states that the student is not a senior (year less than 4) or they haven't reached their senior year yet (year less than or equal to 3). 
      This can be clearer for readers and potentially easier to debug.
      Conciseness: 
      It combines two conditions into a single expression using the OR operator (||), making the code slightly more concise.

   Disadvantages:
      Redundancy: 
      Checking both year < 4 and year <= 3 is redundant because year < 4 already implies year <= 3. 
      This might be seen as unnecessary logic and could be potentially optimized for efficiency.

Keeping `year != '4':
   Advantages:
      Efficiency: 
      Keeping the single comparison (year != '4') avoids redundant checks, potentially improving performance for complex programs.
      Familiarity: 
      If the code is intended for beginners, sticking to the original comparison might be easier to understand and follow.

   Disadvantages:
      Less explicit: 
      It might not be immediately clear that this condition excludes both seniors and students who haven't reached their senior year yet. 
      This could require additional comments or context for clarity.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your priorities. 
If explicitness and ease of understanding are paramount, consider the year < 4 || year <= 3 option. 
If efficiency and familiar comparison are preferred, stick with year != '4'.

Both options are valid and achieve the same functionality. 
Feel free to experiment and choose the one that best suits your code's purpose and target audience.

No, you cannot replace year != '4' with year < 4 or year <= 3 in the else if statement. 
The reason is that the variable year is declared as a char (character) type, not an int (integer) type.

In the program, year is expected to be a character like '1', '2', '3', or '4'. 
When you compare a char with an int, the char is implicitly converted to its ASCII value before the comparison. 
The ASCII values of '1', '2', '3', and '4' are 49, 50, 51, and 52, respectively. 
So, year < 4 or year <= 3 would not work as expected because it would be comparing these ASCII values with 4 or 3, not the actual numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Therefore, you should keep the comparison as year != '4' to correctly check if the year is not equal to 4.

Okay, let's analyze the changes you propose and their impact on who graduates:

1. First if statement
    Original: 
    if ( gpa >= 2.0 && year == '4'): 
    This requires both a GPA of 2.0 or higher AND being a senior (year '4').

    Proposed: 
    if ( gpa >= 2.0 || year == '4'): 
    This requires EITHER a GPA of 2.0 or higher OR being a senior.

This change widens the graduation criteria. 
Previously, only seniors with a 2.0+ GPA qualified. 
Now, anyone with a 2.0+ GPA graduates regardless of year, and seniors automatically graduate even with a lower GPA.

2. Else if statement:
    Original: 
    else if (year != '4' || gpa < 2.0): 
    This excludes students who are NOT seniors (year != '4') OR have a GPA below 2.0.

    Proposed: 
    else if (year != '4' && gpa < 2.0): 
    This excludes students who are NOT seniors (year != '4') AND have a GPA below 2.0.

This change clarifies the logic. 
It no longer implies that someone not in their senior year automatically fails if they have a 2.0+ GPA. 
Now, only students who are not seniors and have a GPA below 2.0 need "more schooling."

Combined effect:
    Who graduates:
        Seniors: 
        All seniors graduate regardless of GPA (due to the "OR" in the first statement).
        Non-seniors: 
        Only non-seniors with a GPA of 2.0 or higher graduate (due to the "AND" in the second statement).

    Who doesn't graduate:
        Non-seniors with a GPA below 2.0.

Handle all cases:
Yes, this revised program handles all combinations of year and GPA.
 Every possible scenario falls under one of the defined conditions, determining their graduation eligibility.

Conclusion:
These changes broaden the graduation criteria, 
making it easier for non-seniors with good GPAs to graduate but still requiring seniors to meet a minimum GPA. 
This revised program handles all cases and provides clearer logic about who needs "more schooling."

In the modified program:
    The if statement now checks if the GPA is greater than or equal to 2.0 or if the year is ‘4’. 
    This means that any student with a GPA of 2.0 or higher, or any student in their senior year (year == '4'), 
    will see the message “It is time to graduate soon”.

    The else if statement now checks if the year is not ‘4’ and if the GPA is less than 2.0. 
    This means that only students who are not in their senior year and have a GPA less than 2.0 will see the message “You need more schooling”.

So, according to this new program:
    Students will see “It is time to graduate soon” if they are in their senior year (year == '4') or 
    if their GPA is 2.0 or higher (gpa >= 2.0).

    Students will see “You need more schooling” if they are not in their senior year (year != '4') and
    their GPA is less than 2.0 (gpa < 2.0).

    However, this program does not handle all cases. 
    Specifically, it does not specify what happens if a student is not in their senior year but has a GPA of 2.0 or higher, 
    or if a student is in their senior year but has a GPA less than 2.0. 

In these cases, the program will not output anything. 
To handle all cases, you might need to add an else statement to cover any remaining scenarios.

<pre>
Yes, you can definitely replace the else if (year != '4' || gpa < 2.0) with just else in the revised program. 
This is because both statements essentially achieve the same outcome: 
    they identify students who don't qualify for graduation based on the previous if statement.

Both versions work because:
    The first if statement checks for either a good GPA (2.0+) or being a senior (year '4'). 
    If either condition is met, the student graduates.

    The else statement then covers all remaining cases: 
        students who are NOT seniors AND have a GPA below 2.0
        . 
This essentially combines the two conditions from the original else if but with simpler syntax.

Using else instead of the explicit else if makes the code more concise and efficient. 
It avoids redundant checks and relies on the logical flow of the program. 
As long as the if statement clearly defines the graduation criteria, 
the else effectively captures everyone who doesn't meet those requirements.

Therefore, replacing else if with else is a valid and potentially preferred option in this specific case. 
It maintains the program's functionality while improving code readability and reducing unnecessary complexity.

Yes, you can replace the else if statement with the single word else. 
This will make the program output “You need more schooling” for all cases not covered by the if statement.

In this version of the program, 
if the GPA is 2.0 or higher or the student is in their senior year, the program will print “It is time to graduate soon”. 
For all other cases, it will print “You need more schooling”. 
This ensures that all possible cases are handled.

    <div class="content hidecontent">
<pre>Removing the break statements in the switch cases will significantly impact the program's execution. 
Here's what happens:

    Without breaks: 
    When a case is matched (e.g., grade is A), the corresponding statement block (cout statement) executes. 
    However, due to the lack of break, it doesn't stop there.
    
    Fall-through: 
    Instead, it automatically falls through to the next case, even if it doesn't match the grade value. 
    This means subsequent statements will also be executed one after the other, until the end of the switch statement or a break is encountered.
    
    Unexpected output: 
    Therefore, the program might output messages for multiple grades instead of just the matching one. 
    For example, if grade is A, it will print "an A - excellent work!" followed by all subsequent messages: 
    "you got a B - good job", "earning a C is satisfactory", and so on.

Overall, removing the break statements transforms the switch into a cascade. 
It becomes more like a series of if-else statements chained together, 
where each case adds its message to the output if the previous cases are also true. 
This can lead to confusing and potentially misleading results for the user as they might not receive a clear and concise evaluation of their grade.

Remember, adding a break after each case statement restores the expected behavior where only the matching message is printed.

I hope this clarifies the effect of removing the break statements and helps you understand the importance of their role in switch cases.

    <div class="content hidecontent">
<pre>If you remove the break statements from each of the cases in your switch statement, the program will exhibit what is known as “fallthrough” behavior. 
This means that once a matching case is found, the program will execute not only the code for that case, 
but also the code for all subsequent cases, until it either reaches a break statement or the end of the switch block.

This is likely not the intended behavior. 
The break statement is used in each case to prevent this fallthrough behavior and ensure that only the code for the matching case is executed.

<pre>This program now incorporates the following changes:
   Breaks added back: 
   Each case in the first switch statement now includes a break statement, 
   ensuring it only prints the intended message and doesn't fall through to subsequent cases.

   Additional switch: 
   A separate switch statement is added after the first one. 
   This one solely focuses on grades above D and prints the appropriate message ("an A - excellent work!" etc.) without repeating the "YOU PASSED!" message.
   
   Default case: 
   Both switch statements have a default case for handling invalid input or grades not requiring additional messages.

With these modifications, the program now behaves as desired:
   Sample run: 
   Entering A as the grade will print "YOU PASSED!" followed by "an A - excellent work!", matching the expected output.

   Clear distinction: 
   The "YOU PASSED!" message is only displayed for D and higher grades in the first switch, 
   while the second switch provides specific feedback for A, B, and C without repetition.





Your code will work as expected, and it’s a valid way to structure the switch statements. 
Here are some pros and cons compared to the previous version:

Pros:
   It’s more explicit. 
   Each case in the switch statement clearly states what will be printed for that case.

Cons:
   It’s more verbose. 
   The same line of code (cout << "YOU PASSED!" << endl;) is repeated in multiple cases.
   It’s less efficient. 
   The program has to check each case separately, even though the output is the same for ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’.

In the previous version, 
we used “fallthrough” behavior in the switch statement to print “YOU PASSED!” for any passing grade (‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, or ‘D’) with a single line of code. 
This made the code more concise and slightly more efficient.

    <div class="content hidecontent">
<pre>In this version of the program, if the grade is ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, or ‘D’, 
the program will print “YOU PASSED!” before printing the specific message for the grade. 
If the grade is ‘F’ or an invalid input, it will not print “YOU PASSED!”.




Yes, your revised program is a valid and alternative approach, and it has both pros and cons compared to the code I provided:

Pros:
   Conciseness: 
   Combining the "YOU PASSED!" message for A, B, C, and D into a single case simplifies the code. 
   It eliminates the need for repeated break statements after each passing grade.

   Efficiency: 
   Checking for passing grades ("A" to "D") first saves some processing time 
   compared to checking for "F" and then all other grades individually.

Cons:
   Readability: 
   Combining the passing message might make it less clear that it applies to all four grades. 
   Readers have to mentally link the case with the message outside the case.

   Maintainability: 
   Adding another grade in the future would require modifying both the first and second switch statements 
   to ensure the "passing" logic and specific feedback remain aligned.

Overall:
Both versions achieve the same functionality. 
Your approach prioritizes conciseness and efficiency, while the one I provided emphasizes clarity and potentially easier future modifications.

Choosing the best option depends on your specific preferences and priorities. 
If you value compactness and efficiency, your code (Bing) is a solid alternative. 
If readability and potential future changes are more important, the version with separate cases might be preferable.

Ultimately, both options are valid and demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired outcome. 
Feel free to experiment and choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.

<pre>Trailing else:
Yes, I used a trailing else in the second set of if-else statements. 
This corresponds to the default case in the original switch statement. 
It handles any scenarios where the grade doesn't match any of the specific cases (A, B, C, D, or F), 
which could be invalid input or other unexpected characters.

Comparison to the original switch statement:
   This version achieves the same functionality as the original program with the switch statement.
   It uses multiple if-else statements to check for specific grades and provide corresponding feedback.
   The trailing else acts as a catch-all for anything not matching the specified grades, similar to the default case in the switch.
   This approach might be less efficient due to potential repeated checks for the same grade in both sets of if-else statements.

Choosing between switch and if-else:
Both versions are valid and have their advantages and disadvantages. 
   The switch statement can be more concise and efficient for specific checks against multiple values, 
   while if-else might be easier to read and modify for beginners or situations with complex logic.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your preferences, code readability, and project requirements.





Yes, your revised program is also a valid and alternative approach with its own pros and cons compared to the version I provided:

Pros:
   Nested logic: 
      It avoids redundant checks for passing grades ("A" to "D") by placing them within the main if statement. 
      This can improve efficiency, especially for large sets of grades that share the same message.
   Reduced code duplication: 
      Combining the "YOU PASSED!" message and the specific feedback for each passing grade into 
      nested if-else statements reduces code redundancy compared to the original version with two separate if-else blocks.

Cons:
   Readability: 
      The nested logic might be less intuitive for beginners compared to separate if statements for each grade. 
      It requires more careful reading to follow the flow and understand which message applies to which grade.
   Maintainability: 
      Adding a new grade in the future might require modifying both the main and nested if statements, potentially impacting multiple levels of logic.

Overall:
Both versions achieve the same functionality, with your approach emphasizing efficiency and compactness while potentially sacrificing some readability and maintainability.

Choosing the best option depends on your specific priorities:
   If efficiency and minimizing redundant code are your top concerns, your nested logic version might be preferable.
   If you prioritize clear and straightforward code that is easier to understand and modify for future changes, the separate if statements might be a better choice.

Ultimately, both approaches are valid and demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired outcome. 
Feel free to experiment and choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.

<div id="ouraccordion">
    <input type="checkbox" id="accordionx33" class="hidecontent"/>
    <label for="accordionx33">Explanation (Gemini)</label>
    <div class="content hidecontent">
<pre>Breakdown of the code: 

1. Include statements:
    #include 《iostream》: 
        This brings in the standard input/output library for basic operations like displaying text and reading user input.
    #include 《iomanip》: 
        This adds formatting options for controlling the output precision (decimal places) in this case.

2. Namespace:
    using namespace std;: 
        This tells the compiler to use the names defined in the std namespace directly, 
        avoiding the need for std:: prefix for each function call.

3. Variable declarations:
    double waterBills[4];: 
        This defines an array named waterBills to store four double-precision floating-point numbers (water bills for each quarter).
    double averageBill = 0.0;: 
        This declares a variable named averageBill of type double and initializes it to 0.0 (representing the sum of bills before calculation).

4. User input loop:
    for (int i = 1; i <= 4; ++i) {...}: 
        This loop iterates four times (i=1 to 4) using an integer counter i.
    cin >> waterBills[i - 1];: 
        This reads the user's input and 
        stores it in the waterBills array at the index corresponding to the current quarter (i-1 because arrays start from 0).

5. Average calculation loop:
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {...}: 
        Another loop iterates through the waterBills array (four elements, hence i=0 to 3).
    averageBill += waterBills[i];: 
        This adds the current element of the array (water bill for a specific quarter) to the averageBill variable, accumulating the total across all quarters.

6. Average calculation and message:
    averageBill /= 12.0;: 
        This divides the total water bill (averageBill) by 12 (number of months) to calculate the average monthly bill.


Why this approach?:
    This approach prioritizes clarity and modularity. 
    It separates tasks into distinct blocks (user input, calculation, messaging) using loops and conditional statements. 
    This makes the code easier to read, understand, and potentially modify in the future.

Alternative options:
    Arrays vs. variables: 
        You could use four separate variables instead of an array for each quarter's bill. 
        This might be slightly less efficient and less flexible for future modifications or individual quarter analysis.
    Looping: 
        Instead of separate loops for user input and calculation, you could combine them into one loop, potentially saving a few lines. 
        However, it might make the code slightly less readable and maintainable.
    Magic numbers: 
        Instead of directly using 75 and 25 in the conditionals, you could define variables for them beforehand. 
        This improves readability and makes it easier to modify the thresholds in the future.

I chose this approach for its balance of readability, ease of understanding, and maintainability. 
It allows you to grasp the logic easily and potentially modify it based on your specific needs.





Pros:
    Conciseness: 
    You use fewer variables and loops, making the code more compact and potentially easier to read for some people.
    Data type: 
    Using float for both bill and average might be more accurate for representing water usage compared to double, especially when dealing with decimals.
    Precision control: 
    Setting the output precision to 2 decimal places ensures a consistent and visually appealing display of the average bill.
    Positive phrasing: 
    Replacing "doing a great job" with "Congratulations" in the conservation message might be more encouraging and impactful.

Cons:
    Magic numbers: 
    Embedding the average calculation directly in the cout statement makes the code less modular and harder to modify if the logic needs to change.
    Limited scope: 
    Using a single total variable for all quarters might not be ideal if you need to analyze individual quarter data later.
    Missing initialization: 
    While the compiler might initialize total to 0, explicitly mentioning it could improve clarity for beginners.

Overall:

Both versions have their pros and cons. It depends on your priorities and preferences:
    If compactness and readability are your main concerns, your revised program might be a good choice. 
    However, it sacrifices some modularity and flexibility.
    If you prioritize explicitness, maintainability, and potential future data analysis, 
    the original version with separated variables and loops might be preferable.

Ultimately, both options are valid and achieve the desired outcome. You can choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.

<pre>This program incorporates the features demonstrated in the sample runs:
    User input validation: 
        It ensures the user enters a non-negative integer (>= 1) through a loop checking for invalid values.
    Quantity discounts: 
        It uses nested if-else statements to calculate the appropriate discount based on the number of shirts.
    Price calculation: 
        It applies the discount to the base price and multiplies by the quantity to get the total price.
    Output formatting: 
        It displays the price per shirt and total cost with two decimal places for clarity.





Both versions achieve the same functionality, but there are pros and cons to each approach:

Your version:
Pros:
    Conciseness: 
        Uses fewer lines of code, making it more compact and potentially easier to read for some developers.
    Efficiency: 
        Calculates discounts directly on the costPerShirt variable, potentially avoiding redundant calculations.
    Early exit: 
        Handles invalid input quickly and exits the program, avoiding unnecessary processing.

Cons:
    Magic numbers: 
        Embeds discount percentages directly in the code, making it less flexible and harder to modify future changes.
    Less readable logic: 
        Nested if statements can be less intuitive for beginners compared to separate discount calculations.
    Potential redundancy: 
        Depending on how many discounts are added in the future, the logic might become repetitive.

Original version:
Pros:
    Clarity: 
        Uses separate variables and calculations for discounts, 
        making the logic more explicit and easier to understand.
    Flexibility: 
        Allows easier addition or modification of discounts in the future without altering other parts of the code.
    Maintainability: 
        Separates concerns (validation, discount calculation, price calculation) into distinct blocks, 
        making it easier to maintain and debug.

Cons:
    Slightly more verbose: 
        Requires a few extra lines for discount calculations and variable declarations.
    Potential inefficiency: 
        Might perform redundant calculations if the discount structure involves overlapping ranges.

Overall:
Both versions are valid and achieve the same goal. 
Choosing the best option depends on your preferences and priorities:

    If compactness and efficiency are your main concerns, your version might be preferable. 
    However, it sacrifices some flexibility and readability.

    If you prioritize clarity, maintainability, and potential future modifications, 
    the original version with separate calculations might be a better choice.

<pre>This program prompts the user for the number of shirts they want, 
checks if the input is valid, applies the appropriate discount based on the number of shirts, 
and then calculates and prints the cost per shirt and the total cost. 
The setprecision function is used to limit the output to two decimal places. 





Your code is correct and will work as expected. 
Here are some pros and cons compared to the previous version:
Pros:
    Your code uses a do-while loop to validate user input, 
    which ensures that the program will keep prompting the user until a valid number of shirts is entered. 
    This can make the program more user-friendly.
    Your code uses constants for the base price and minimum number of shirts, which can make the code easier to understand and modify.

Cons:
    It’s slightly less efficient because it needs to check the number of shirts twice: 
    once to determine if the user passed and once to print the grade message.

In the previous version, 
the program checks the number of shirts only once and determines 
both if the user passed and what message to print based on that single check. 
However, both versions are correct and the choice between them 
can depend on personal preference and the specific requirements of your program.

<h1>Exercise 3</h1>
<p>The University of Guiness charges $3000 per semester for in-state tuition and $4500 per semester for out-of-state tuition.<br>
    In addition, room and board is $2500 per semester for in-state students and $3500 per semester for out-of-state students.<br>
    Write a program that prompts the user for their residential status (i.e., in-state or out-of-state) and whether they require room and board (Y or N).<br>
    The program should then compute and output their bill for that semester.<br>
    Use the sample output below:
<pre>Sample Run 1:
Please input "I" if you are in-state or "O" if you are out-of-state:
I
Please input "Y" if you require room and board and "N" if you do not:
N
Your total bill for this semester is $3000
Sample Run 2:
Please input "I" if you are in-state or "O" if you are out-of-state:
O
Please input "Y" if you require room and board and "N" if you do not:
Y
Your total bill for this semester is $8000</pre>
    </p>
<pre><code>#include 《iostream》
#include 《iomanip》

using namespace std;

int main() {
  char inState, roomBoard;
  double tuition, totalBill;

  // Prompt and validate residential status
  do {
    cout << "Please input \"I\" if you are in-state or \"O\" if you are out-of-state: ";
    cin >> inState;
  } while (inState != 'I' && inState != 'O');

  // Set tuition based on residential status
  if (inState == 'I') {
    tuition = 3000.0;
  } else {
    tuition = 4500.0;
  }

  // Prompt and validate room & board choice
  do {
    cout << "Please input \"Y\" if you require room and board and \"N\" if you do not: ";
    cin >> roomBoard;
  } while (roomBoard != 'Y' && roomBoard != 'N');

  // Add room & board cost if applicable
  if (roomBoard == 'Y') {
    if (inState == 'I') {
      totalBill = tuition + 2500.0;
    } else {
      totalBill = tuition + 3500.0;
    }
  } else {
    totalBill = tuition;
  }

  // Display bill amount

<pre>Similarities:
    Both programs achieve the same goal: 
        calculating the University of Guiness semester bill based on residential status and room & board choice.
    Both programs use character input for user selection, validation loops for invalid input, and conditional logic to set tuition and room & board costs.
    Both programs display the final bill amount with two decimal places for clarity.

Differences:
    Data types:
        Draft A uses integer variables for tuition, roomBoardCost, and totalBill. 
        This might not be ideal for representing precise dollar amounts.
        Draft B uses double variables for tuition and totalBill, providing more accurate representation of financial values.

    Calculation approach:
        Draft A utilizes a ternary operator for both tuition and room & board cost calculations. 
        This can be more compact, but less intuitive for beginners to follow.
        Draft B uses separate if statements for each calculation. 
        This makes the logic clearer and easier to understand and modify.
    
    Output formatting:
        Draft A explicitly sets the output precision within the cout statement.
        Draft B uses fixed and setprecision statements before the output, potentially improving readability and maintainability.

Overall:
Both programs are valid and functional. 
Here's a breakdown of their pros and cons:
    Draft A:
        Pros:
            More compact due to ternary operators.
            Might be slightly faster due to fewer variable declarations.

        Cons:
            Less readable logic for beginners.
            Integer variables might not be accurate for financial calculations.
            Formatting embedded within the cout statement might be less flexible.

    Draft B:
        Pros:
            Clear and easy-to-follow logic using separate if statements.
            Double variables provide better precision for financial values.
            Formatting settings applied before output for better maintainability.

        Cons:
            Slightly more verbose due to extra if statements and variable declarations.
            Might be marginally slower due to additional variable access.

Recommendation:
    If clarity and maintainability are your priorities, Draft B might be a better choice. 
    It sacrifices a bit of compactness but offers a more explicit and easier-to-modify codebase.
    However, if compactness and efficiency are your top concerns, Draft A could be a suitable option. 

Just keep in mind the potential drawbacks in terms of readability and data type precision.





Comparing Draft B and your alternative code:

Similarities:
    Both programs aim to calculate the University of Guiness semester bill based on residential status and room & board choice.
    Both use character input for user selections and conditional logic to determine tuition and room & board costs.
    Both display the final bill amount.

Differences:
    Data types:
        Draft B: 
            Uses double for tuition and total cost, offering better precision for financial values.
        Your code: 
            Uses int for tuition, roomBoard, and total bill, potentially less accurate for dollar amounts.

    Logic structure:
        Draft B: 
            Employs separate if statements for residential status and room & board, making it clear and modular.
        Your code: 
            Combines residential status and room & board costs within a single if-else block, potentially less intuitive for complex conditions.

    Error handling:
        Draft B: 
            Uses separate if statements for invalid input, handling each type differently.
        Your code: 
            Handles both invalid input types (residential & room & board) within the same if-else, potentially less specific.

    Output formatting:
        Draft B: 
            Explicitly sets precision for bill amount with fixed and setprecision.
        Your code: 
            Outputs bill amount directly without formatting, potentially less visually appealing.

Overall, both programs are functional, but they have distinct trade-offs:
    Draft B:
        Pros:
            Clear and well-structured logic.
            More accurate data types for financial calculations.
            Explicit and separate error handling for different invalid inputs.
            Formatted output for better readability.

        Cons:
            Slightly more verbose due to multiple if statements.
            Might require modifications for adding new cost components.

    Your code:
        Pros:
            More concise due to combined if-else block.
            Potentially easier to adapt for adding more cost variations.

        Cons:
            Logic might be less intuitive for beginners.
            Data types might not be ideal for precise financial calculations.
            Less specific error handling for different invalid inputs.
            Unformatted output could be less visually appealing.

Recommendation:
    Choosing the "better" option depends on your priorities:
        For clear logic, accuracy, and explicit error handling, Draft B might be better.
        If conciseness and adaptability for future cost variations are your top concerns, your code could be suitable.

Ultimately, both options are valid starting points. You can modify them further based on your needs and desired features.
