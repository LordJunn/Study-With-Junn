<h1>Question 1</h1>
<pre><span id="question">In the development and design of most modern operating systems, a modular kernel may be the best of the design techniques. 
Explain why this is so.</span> [4m]
        
Uses object-oriented approach, with a relatively small core kernel and a set of modules which can be linked in dynamically. 
Each core component is separate
Each talks to the others over known interfaces
Each is loadable as needed within the kernel

<br><br><h1>Question 2</h1>
<pre><span id="question">Operating systems (OS) are interrupt driven. How interrupts are handled by the OS?</span> [2m]
        

</pre>
        
<br><br><h1>Question 3</h1>
<pre><span id="question">What are the differences between a trap and an interrupt? What is the use of each type?</span> [4m]
        

</pre>
    
<br><br><h1>Question 4</h1>
<pre><span id="question">Explain how does stack overflow happen in a process?</span> [2m]
    
The stack and the heap start at opposite ends of the process's free space and grow towards each other. 
If they should ever meet, then either a stack overflow error will occur, or else a call to new or malloc will fail due to insufficient memory available.

<br><br><h1>Question 4</h1>
Context Switch occurred when CPU switches from one process to another process.<br><br>
<pre><span id="question">i) Explain what the steps are involved during the context switch</span> [0.5m]
It involves saving and restoring all of the registers and program counter(s), as well as the process control blocks.
    
<span id="question">ii) Explain why an efficient Operating System should minimize the occurrence of context switch</span> [0.5m]
Context-switch time is overhead; the system does no useful work while switching

â€¢ User Interface (UI):
    o Types include Command-Line Interface (CLI), Graphical User Interface (GUI), and Batch.
    o Examples: Windows uses a GUI with CLI options; MacOS includes both GUI and UNIX shell options.
â€¢ Program Execution:
    o Loads programs into memory and manages normal or error-induced termination.
â€¢ I/O Operations:
    o Handles file access or device communication needs.
â€¢ File-System Manipulation:
    o Manages file creation, deletion, search, permissions, and directory operations.
â€¢ Communication:
    o Supports data exchange between processes via shared memory or message passing.
â€¢ Error Detection:
    o Identifies and manages hardware or program errors to maintain stability.
â€¢ Resource Allocation:
    o Distributes resources among multiple processes/users.
â€¢ Protection and Security:
    o Ensures controlled access to resources and defends against unauthorized access.
