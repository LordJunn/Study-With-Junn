<h1>Question 1</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">What are the basic attributes of a file?</span>

Name, the symbolic file name
Identifier: non-human readable name for the file. It is a number to identify the file within the file system
Type: to identify the file type
Location: a pointer to a device and location of the file
Size; in bytes, words or blocks
Protection; Access control information determines how can do reading, writing, or execution
Time, date, and user Identification; info on creation, last modification, and last use, this info is useful
for security and usage monitoring.

</pre>

<h1>Question 2</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Some systems provide file sharing by maintaining a single copy of a file; other systems maintain several copies, one for each of the users sharing the file. 
Discuss the relative merits of each approach.</span>

With a single copy, several concurrent updates to a file may result in user obtaining incorrect information, and the
file being left in an incorrect state. With multiple copies, there is storage waste and the various copies may not be
consistent with respect to each other.

</pre>

<h1>Question 3</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">What data structures can be used for directory information? What problems might arise with these data structures?</span>

a. Linear list is slow to access particular file. Also must decide how to take care of deletions (mark,
copy last entry to it, ...).
b. Linked list requires storage overhead for pointers; also, if link goes bad, rest of files are lost.
c. Sorted list requires list always to be sorted, which means extra work on creating and deleting
files.
d. Binary tree suffers like linked list.
e. Hash tables are set up for a maximum number of files; also there is a problem with collisions.

</pre>

<h1>Question 4</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Among the three ways (Contiguous, Linked, and Indexed) of allocating storage, which one is the fastest?</span>

• Contiguous is fastest.
• Linked is slower, because disk head may have to move between accesses of file.
• Indexed is slowest, unless the entire index is smaller in size and can be kept in memory at all times. If not, extra
time is needed to access next block of file indexes.

</pre>

<h1>Question 5</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Given a system that supports strategies of contiguous, linked, and indexed allocation, describe the characteristics of the files suitable to be used for each strategy.</span>

• Contiguous – if file is usually accessed sequentially, if file is relatively small.
• Linked – if file is large and usually accessed sequentially.
• Indexed – if file is large and usually accessed randomly.

</pre>

<h1>Question 6</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Consider a system where free space is kept in a free-space list.
a. Suppose that the pointer to the free-space list is lost. Can the system reconstruct the free-space list? Explain your answer.
b. Suggest a scheme to ensure that the pointer is never lost as a result of memory failure.</span>

In order to reconstruct the free list, it would be necessary to perform “garbage collection.” This would entail
searching the entire directory structure to determine which blocks are already allocated to files. Those remaining
unallocated blocks could be re-linked as the free-space list. The free-space list pointer could be stored on the disk,
perhaps in several places.

</pre>

<h1>Question 7</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Suppose that a file system contains 5 direct pointers to data blocks, 1 indirect pointer, 1 double indirect pointer and 1 triple indirect pointer. 
Assume that the size of the data blocks is 1Kb and each block numbers are represented as 4 byte unsigned integers.
(a) What is maximum number of bytes addressed by 5 direct pointers?
(b) What is maximum number of bytes addressed by single indirect pointer?
(c) What is the maximum number of bytes addressed by double indirect pointer?
(d) What is the maximum number of bytes addressed by triple indirect pointer?
(e) What is the maximum file size that can be supported by this file system?</span>

(a) What is maximum number of bytes addressed by 5 direct pointers?
= Number of direct pointers * Blocksize
= 5 * 1Kb
= 5Kb

(b) What is maximum number of bytes addressed by single indirect pointer?
= NumberOfEntries * BlockSize
= (Blocksize / BlockNumberSize) * BlockSize
= (1Kb / 4b) * 1Kb
= 256 * 1Kb
= 256Kb

(c) What is the maximum number of bytes addressed by double indirect pointer?
= NumberOfEntries^2 * BlockSize
= (Blocksize / BlockNumberSize)^2 * BlockSize
= (1Kb / 4b)^2 * 1Kb
= (2^10 / 2^2)^2 * (2^10b)
= (2^8)^2 * (2^10)b
= (2^16) * (2^10)b
= 2^6 * 2^20 b
= 64 Mb

(d) What is the maximum number of bytes addressed by triple indirect pointer?
= NumberOfEntries^3 * BlockSize
= (Blocksize / BlockNumberSize)^3 * BlockSize
= (1Kb / 4b)^3 * 1Kb
= (2^10 / 2^2)^3 * (2^10b)
= (2^8)^3 * (2^10)b
= (2^24) * (2^10)b
= 2^4 * 2^30 b
= 16 Gb

(e) What is the maximum file size that can be supported by this file system?
= 16Gb + 64Mb + 256Kb + 5 Kb
= 16777216 Kb + 65536 Kb + 256 Kb + 5Kb
= 16843013 Kb (16.06Gb)

</pre>

<h1>Question 8</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Consider a file system that uses inodes to represent files. Disk blocks are 8-KB in size and a pointer to a disk block requires 4 bytes. 
This file system has 12 direct disk blocks, plus single, double, and triple indirect disk blocks. What is the maximum size of a file that can be stored in this file system?</span>

(12 * 8 /KB/) + (2048 * 8 /KB) + (2048 * 2048 * 8 /KB) + (2048 * 2048 * 2048 * 8 /KB) = 64 terabytes
