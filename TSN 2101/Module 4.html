<h1>Question 1</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Why is it important for the scheduler to distinguish I/O-bound programs from CPU-bound programs?</span>

I/O-bound programs perform only a small amount of computation before performing I/O operations. 
These programs typically do not consume the entire CPU quantum. 
On the other hand, CPU-bound programs use their entire quantum without performing blocking I/O operations. 
By distinguishing between I/O-bound and CPU-bound programs, the scheduler can allocate higher priority to I/O-bound programs, 
allowing them to execute ahead of CPU-bound programs, improving resource utilization and system responsiveness.

</pre>

<br><br><h1>Question 2</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?</span>

<b>Preemptive scheduling</b> allows a process to be interrupted in the middle of its execution, taking the CPU away and allocating it to another process. 
<b>Non-preemptive scheduling</b> ensures that a process relinquishes control of the CPU only when it has completed its current CPU burst.

</pre>

<br><br><h1>Question 3</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Explain the difference in the degree to which the following scheduling algorithms discriminate in favor of short processes.</span>

a) <b>FCFS (First Come, First Served)</b> – FCFS discriminates against short jobs since any short job arriving after long jobs will have to wait longer.

b) <b>RR (Round Robin)</b> – RR treats all jobs equally by giving them equal CPU time (quantum). 
As a result, short jobs will finish quicker since they will complete within their first CPU burst.

</pre>

<br><br><h1>Question 4</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Consider the following set of processes with the length of the CPU-burst time given in milliseconds:</span>

<b>Process</b> | <b>Burst-time</b> | <b>Arrival time</b>  
P1      | 10         | 0  
P2      | 2          | 1  
P3      | 3          | 2  
P4      | 1          | 3  
P5      | 5          | 4  

a) <span style="color: blue;">Draw the Gantt charts illustrating the execution of these processes using FCFS, Non-Preemptive SJF, 
Preemptive SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First), and RR (quantum=2) scheduling.</span>

<b>Gantt Charts:</b>

b) <span style="color: blue;">What is the turnaround time of each process and also average turnaround time for each of the scheduling algorithms?</span>

<b>Turnaround time = Finish Time - Arrival Time</b>

| Process | FCFS | RR | Non-preemptive SJF  | Preemptive SJF |
|---------|------|----|---------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 10   | 21 | 10                  | 21             |
| P2      | 11   | 3  | 12                  | 2              |
| P3      | 13   | 10 | 14                  | 5              |
| P4      | 13   | 6  | 8                   | 1              |
| P5      | 17   | 15 | 17                  | 8              |

<b>Average Turnaround Time:</b>
- **FCFS:** 64/5 = 12.8ms
- **RR:** 55/5 = 11ms
- **Non-preemptive SJF:** 61/5 = 12.2ms
- **Preemptive SJF:** 37/5 = 7.4ms

c) <span style="color: blue;">What is the waiting time of each process and also average waiting time for each of the scheduling algorithms?</span>

<b>Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - CPU Burst Time</b>

| Process | FCFS | RR  | Non-preemptive SJF  | Preemptive SJF |
|---------|------|-----|---------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 0    | 11  | 0                   | 11             |
| P2      | 9    | 1   | 10                  | 0              |
| P3      | 10   | 7   | 11                  | 2              |
| P4      | 12   | 5   | 7                   | 0              |
| P5      | 12   | 10  | 12                  | 3              |

<b>Average Waiting Time:</b>
- **FCFS:** 43/5 = 8.6ms
- **RR:** 34/5 = 6.8ms
- **Non-preemptive SJF:** 40/5 = 8ms
- **Preemptive SJF:** 16/5 = 3.2ms

d) <span style="color: blue;">Which of the above scheduling algorithm results in the minimal average waiting time (over all processes)?</span>

<b>Preemptive SJF</b> results in the minimal average waiting time.

</pre>

<br><br><h1>Question 5</h1>

<pre><span style="color: blue;">Consider the following processes with the length of a CPU burst time given in milliseconds. Assume that lower numbers represent higher priority.</span>

<b>Process</b> | <b>Arrival Time</b> | <b>Priority</b> | <b>Burst Time</b>  
P0      | 0            | 2        | 8  
P5      | 0            | 1        | 6  
P1      | 4            | 5        | 15  
P4      | 9            | 4        | 13  
P2      | 7            | 3        | 9  
P3      | 13           | 1        | 5

<b>Average Turnaround Time:</b>
- **Non-preemptive SJF:** 131/6 = 21.83ms
- **Preemptive SJF:** 131/6 = 21.83ms
- **Non-preemptive Priority:** 131/6 = 21.83ms
- **Preemptive Priority:** 135/6 = 22.5ms
