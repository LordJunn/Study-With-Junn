# Study-With-Junn
Hello. This site is mostly used for Multimedia University Cyberjaya FCI students.     
It contains tutorials, lecture slides and past year (exam/test) questions, with answers.   
Others may be free to use it as well for reference purposes, but the syllabus is mostly related to FCI.
