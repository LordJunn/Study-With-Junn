<h1>Question 1</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>What do you mean by CIA Triad? Briefly explain each security goal with an example.</span>
    
CIA Triad is a major goal of data security that comprises confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
a) Confidentiality: It ensures the secrecy of the transmitted data from passive attacks such as interruption and traffic analysis. 
b) Integrity: Assurance of the exact same data sent and received without having been altered, modified, or replayed. 
c) Availability: It describes the accessibility of the resource or data to always authorized users all the time.

</pre>

<h1>Question 2</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>What is the difference between passive and active security attacks? State the general approach that can be used for handling each type of these attacks.</span>
    
a) Passive attack: The attacker does not perform modification to the content of the data sent. For instance, spoofing and traffic analysis. 
To prevent spoofing the sent data is encrypted. 
To prevent traffic analysis the sent data is randomized. 

b) Active attack: The attacker performs changes to the content of the original data sent. For example, interruption, alteration (modification), and fabrication. 
To prevent interruption - installation of antivirus/malware to block potential DoS attack. 
To prevent alteration (modification) - the data is signed digitally. 
To prevent fabrication - the user's identities are identified before sending data (identification).

</pre>

<h1>Question 3</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Give an example of the type of attacks that will threaten availability and explain briefly.</span>
    
Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: This attack aims to make a network service unavailable by overwhelming the target with excessive traffic.
Example: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where multiple compromised systems flood a website with traffic, causing it to crash.

</pre>

<h1>Question 4</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Briefly explain the meaning of the following terms related to security services:</span>
    
Authentication: The assurance that the communication entity is the one that it claims to be.  
Non-repudiation: Provides protection against denial by one of the entities involved in a communication of having participated in all or part of the communication.

</pre>

<h1>Question 5</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Briefly discuss the basic model for network security and explain how person A can transmit the information in a secure manner to person B using this model.</span>
    
When person A (sender) intends to send a message secretly to person B (receiver), he will first request TTP to obtain secret information, which allows him to transform the data into a secure message via some transformation techniques. 
The secure message is transmitted through the information channel, where the potential opponent may intercept and obtain it for an attack. 
Person B, who receives the secure message, will request his secret information from TTP (whenever necessary) to transform the secure message back.

</pre>

<h1>Question 6</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Briefly describe the model for network access security with typical measures to be taken for security.</span>
No answer here for now.

</pre>

<h1>Question 7</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Identify the type of security attack in the following example and briefly explain the reason for your answer. 
When purchasing an item from the seller, person A gave an instruction to the bank to deduct RM 500.   
Later person A found that instead of RM500, RM5000 was deducted from the account. How can you avoid this type of attack?</span>
    
Modification/alteration. Integrity property is violated. 
The transaction should be encrypted so that the transaction amount is secret to an unauthorized party. 
In addition, the implementation of a digital signature can be done for validation by the receiver bank.

</pre>

<h1>Question 8</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Briefly explain the differences between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography models.</span>
    
a) Symmetric cryptography: 
Uses only a single private key in the encryption and decryption process. Both sender and receiver share this same private key.  

b) Asymmetric cryptography: 
Uses two different keys — a public key and a private key. 
The sender uses the public key to encrypt plaintext, while the receiver uses the private key to decrypt the ciphertext.

</pre>
 
<h1>Question 9</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Answer the following questions with respect to symmetric cryptography. 
In a cricket team, there are ‘11’ players. 
How many keys are needed if all the players need to send secret messages to each other?
How many keys are needed if everyone trusts the team’s coach? 
If a player needs to send a message to another player, he/she first sends it to the coach, and the coach then sends the message to the other student.</span>

No answer here for now.

</pre>

<h1>Question 10</h1>
<pre><span id='question'>Repeat Question 9, assuming the usage of asymmetric cryptography.</span>

No answer here for now.
